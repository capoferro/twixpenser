This ruby script + cron job allows you to text message expense reports to be posted (via curl) to the google spread sheet that calculates the shared expenses.

h2. Twitter Format:

	@d <twitter account> <cost><delimiter><item name><delimiter><item description>@

h2. Example yaml:

    @:delimiter: !@
    @:account: mytwixpenser@
    @:pass: mypass@
    @:url: http://spreadsheets.google.com/formResponse?formkey=mykey@

Based on the above information, tweeting: @d mytwixpenser 25.15!myitem!This is the item I bought@
	
...will produce...
	
|_. Time Stamp|_. Item|_. Description|_. Amount|_. Who Paid?|_. Original Tweet|
|(Time of Tweet)|myitem|This is the item I bought|25.15 |<name of tweeter>|d mytwixpenser 25.15!myitem!This is the item I bought|

h2. Step by step:

* Create a new twitter account @ http://www.twitter.com

* Follow your new twitter account, and have your new twitter account follow you.

* Do the following
 @git clone git://github.com/bluepojo/twixpenser.git@
 @cd twixpenser@
 @mv example.twix.conf.yml twix.conf.yml@
 @emacs twix.conf.yml # or which ever your favorite text editor is@

* Enter your new twitter account information in the fields provided in twix.conf.yml

* Here you have the option of selecting a different delimiter for your text messages.  Default is "!".  Note the format above to see how the delimiter is used.

* Find your google form's key.  This is that random string of characters on the end of the link that you use to access the form. Paste it exactly after the = in the url.

* Todo: how to set up the google form. (with example?)
